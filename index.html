            The images below show the home page of the Anunciation Greek Orthodox Church in Cranston, RI. At first glance, the main page
            does not seem to contain many problems, but as follow along this site, you will uncover some design flaws. We will 
            go over those problems and offer up a potential redesign of the website!

    <h3>Visual Redesign:</h3>
    <div id="p2">
        <p>
            Now that we have identified some design problems in this website, let's use all that information to guide us as we 
            redesign the website!
         </p>
         <p>
            Using Balsamiq, we can make some low-fidelity prototypes. Below you will see a <b>low-fidelity prototype</b> for our redesign 
            on a mobile device, tablet, and a desktop.
         </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="wf-container">
        <img class="wf-item" src="./mobilewf.png" alt="mobile wireframe">
        <img class="wf-item" src="./tabletwf.png" alt="tablet wireframe">
        <img class="wf-item" src="./desktopwf.png" alt="desktop wireframe">
    </div>
    <div id="p2">
        <p>
            These low-fidelity prototypes effectively solve many of the problems that users may encounter. One notable issue was a lengthy amount of 
            menu tabs which can easily confuse a user trying to navigate the page efficiently. I found that many of that information can be transferred 
            onto the home page to make better use of space while still maintaining a legible interface. Additionally, users can follow a more clear sequence
            on the page. Essentially, instead of all the information being cluttered, it is now simplified to blocks of information with clear divisions. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Before we begin making high-fidelity prototypes, let's make a <b>visual design style guide</b> so that our design is consistent across the board.
            This can be done using Figma!         
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="style-container">
        <img class="style-item" src="./cp.png" alt="color palette">
        <img class="style-item" src="./tp.png" alt="typography">
        <img class="style-item" src="./buttons.png" alt="desktop wireframe">
    </div>

    <div id="p2">
        <p>
            Upon looking at this visual design guide, you might notice that the colors selected are very different than those in the original website.
            This is done on purpose because I believe a more clear and modern color scheme will help with the overall look and feel of the site. On the 
            original site, there was no clear color palette so this will definitely make the site more visually pleasing. Blue can be a very friendly and welcoming
            color which will help this site serve its purpose to engage with new users and get more people involved with them.
         </p>

         <p>
            Let's now use our low-fidelity prototypes and visual design style guide to create some <b>high-fidelity prototypes</b> for mobile, tablet, and desktop. 
            
         </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="hp-container">

        <img class="hp-item" src="./mobilehp.png" alt="mobile hi fi prototype">
        <img class="hp-item" src="./tablethp.png" alt="tablet hi fi prototype">
        <img class="hp-item" src="./desktophp.png" alt="desktop hi fi prototype">
    </div>

    <div id="p2">
        <p>
            Here we can see that the color palettes, typography, and buttons from the style guide have been used effectively here to create
            the high-fidelity prototypes. However, one important thing we need to ensure before we start to code our design, is how to make our
            website responsive. A responsive website is one that automatically changes size in conjunction to the screen size changing.   
         </p>
         <p>
            This will be accomplished in many ways. Firstly, we will use flexbox primarily because of its ability to be dynamic and that will be 
            useful as we play around with different screen sizes.
         </p>
         <p>
            Another thing to be aware of is that our text may change size as we change screen sizes. We can adjust this by using 'media query' 
            to tell the website to change font and text sizes dependent on what the desired screen size is.
         </p>
